Ten students (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) are going to get there pictured clicked by university camera. Only one student can enter the camera room while the other students wait outside the room. The students are waiting in a queue to enter the room. To pass time the students start to play a game. In this game the students give candies to each other in a random manner (assume the students never run out of candies). They decide that the student with highest candies will be allowed to enter. When the student with highest amount of candies enter the room, the student starts the game again. Initially the students do not know if there is any body in the room and they start their game and the student with highest candies enter. Write and implement the algorithm to schedule such and compute the waiting and turnaround time. Consider the arrival time and burst time as given by the user.
